    <h1>Pumpkin Pie with Espresso Cream Cheese Swirl</h1>

    <p><em>Pumpkin Pie</em>s an all-time holiday dessert classic, but maybe it's time for a glow up. For Thanksgiving this year, Allrecipes challenged 5 of our favorite bakers to upgrade our basic pumpkin pie recipe. The rules? The base ingredients needed to stay the same, and the bakers could only use five additional ingredients for their upgrade. Check out the rest of the pumpkin pie recipes from our challenge, here.</p>
    <p>When I set out to invent a twist on the classic pumpkin pie, my mind immediately went to a fall classic, the pumpkin spice latte. While I can't say that I've ever actually had a pumpkin spice latte, the scent of warm fall spices and coffee sounded so inviting that I had to give it a try.</p>
    <p>First, I had to figure out the best way to approach combining the flavors of warmly spiced pumpkin custard and rich coffee. I started by adding a little bit more pumpkin spice to the pumpkin mixture so the filling could stand up to the coffee flavor. I have my own house blend of pumpkin spice that includes cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, and cardamom, but any pumpkin spice blend is welcome here.</p>
